                <p>The voice acting for Ben Jammin in Bloons baffles me.  Any voice actor, when shown a picture of Ben Jammin, would've done some high-pitched exaggerated voice.  Here the actor barely changes his voice at all.  My theory is that the voice actor was a developer they got at the last second when they realized he didn't have a voice line.</p>

                <p>After owning one of these I've realized there's no practical way to eat them.  Unless the inside is hollow, you'll end up gnawing at it like a squirrel or messily sawing it with a knife.  It's better as a piece of decor, a little nicknack if you will.  Put it on your shelf it will look nice there.</p>
